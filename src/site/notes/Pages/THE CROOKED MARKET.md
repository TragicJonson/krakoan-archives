REGENT: **MAD JIM JASPERS**

In every reality where there is a need, there is an enterprising soul to rise and meet it. But the truly most enterprising of all seek out the streets of the Crooked Market.

The Crooked Market is a sort of [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]]ian port city where nearly anything can be acquired for a price. As the Otherworld is the nexus of all realities, the Crooked Market is a popular place to go to acquire items from a foreign reality -- or even for a bit of illicit inter-reality goods-fencing.

Like many of the kingdoms of Otherworld, the Crooked Market began as a small operation headed up by the reality refugee Mad Jim Jaspers and quickly attracted other reality refugees fleeing incursions. Today, the Crooked Market is a bustling crisscross of lamplit streets, noisy markets, lively pubs and dark alleyways.

The Crooked Market seems to circulate an almost baffling amount of wealth -- it seems impossible that so much should travel through one place in the Multiverse, but every kind of coin can pay for any kind of desire in the Crooked Market, and entire economies can form around the trading of goods that cannot meet anywhere else.

Travelers to the market are advised to be covertly armed.

Do not trust anyone who presents as constabulary, as they are all known to be either highly corrupt or simply violent.

It is said that it's foolish to worry about the sheriffs who walk with coins jingling in their pockets; it is the silent ones to worry about. The corrupt ones in the Crooked street do it for money -- the mad ones do it for the thrill of it.

Between the unfriendly locals and the labyrinthine streets and buildings, the only way to travel in the Crooked Market is with a local guide. There's always one willing -- and they're always ready to barter on the price -- but they're clever at making a deal that benefits them more than it does their client, so be wise.
