Like any experiment, Sinister's breeding program would produce results that tell outside of the expected range: a failure rate. Every generation of mutant Chimeras had outliers, but the expectation was that these failures would be controllable at worst and acceptable at best.

**Failure rates per generation:**
- Generation One...00.3%
- Generation Two... 01.2%
- Generation Three...09.4%
- Generation Four...62.3%

Generation Three had a ten percent failure rate where, in spite of their being bred for war, these mutants developed passive, "peace-time" power sets. Almost all of these "outlier mutants" also had personality profiles that lent themselves to pacifism and an obsession with creation myths. They also rejected the idea of personal identities and refused individual names. These variants were all called Cardinal.
