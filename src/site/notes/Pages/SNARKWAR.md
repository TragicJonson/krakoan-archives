Snarkwar is the colloquial term for a [**Zn'rx](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Zn'rx?so=search) War of Succession**.

Xenobiology has yet to tell us exactly how the children of a **Zn'rx regent** know instantly that the regent has died. However, the immediate reaction is always a violent urge on the part of the fallen regent's heirs to claim the vacant alpha position by any means necessary, h[]()eedless of any collateral damage caused. Though the urge can be resisted or satisfied through single combat, recent attempts at modernizing the succession process were derailed by the **Hyinar Usurpation** and the resultant rise to power of the traditionalist **Stote**, who undid many of the Bhadsha era's reforms during his brief time on the throne.
