**Recent Movement:** 
:::On-Island: Assault on the Hatchery 
(Egg injured and currently recovering in Healing Gardens) 
(Hatchery database breached) 
:::Off-Island: Gate traffic: Red Square of Moscow 

**Analytics:** 
The Hatchery database breach focused on [Omega Red](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Omega_Red?so=search)'s records. This was immediately followed by a brazen escape to Moscow, indicating a causal relationship and an intention never to return. 

Suspected Motive: 
:::resurrection classified
:::terminated by Beast 
:::resurrected with memory wipes and surveillance tracker 

Primary Question: How did Omega Red know to look? Probable Answer: The [[Pages/CEREBRO\|CEREBRO]] Sword
