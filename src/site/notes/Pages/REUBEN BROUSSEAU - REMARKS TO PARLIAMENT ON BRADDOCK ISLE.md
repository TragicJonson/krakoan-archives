"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Prime Minister, my lords, and Members of the House of Commons:

With permission, I rise to inform the House of recent events occurring in the unrecognized Krakoan protectorate known as [[Pages/BRADDOCK ISLE\|BRADDOCK ISLE]]. 

As you know, diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and the nation of Krakoa have been chilly at best. Since opting to no longer allow our citizens access to risky mutant drugs, we have been maligned and villainized by the mutant population. One wonders what their aims are. But nonetheless, I am a man of faith -- in my country and in my work. I believe that we must co-exist with mutants, but protect ourselves first.

Most recently, the Krakoans have claimed a piece of land near the southwestern Isles of Scilly, a piece that has come unmoored from the mainland. It should be clear to the House, if it is not, that this is no accident or natural phenomena -- it is a deliberate act of violent sovereignty and expansion on the part of Krakoans. In the name of a continued peace, we have hesitantly not yet reclaimed it.

But now, Braddock Isle emits signals we cannot decipher, dangerously close to our own shores. My own specialist, Marianna Stern, has provided that information in your reading materials. We cannot allow such a crisis as this to pass lightly. We do not know the extent of mutant power or ability. We know there are battlefields where they will win. In outright war against these monsters, we would suffer terribly. That time has not yet come.

My lords, we cannot permit the Krakoans to take Britain from us piece by piece. They may come with flowers, with beauty and galas, and even with the trappings of our own history, but they are not us, my friends.

There was a time when those mutants who have served both the United Kingdom and their own kind called themselves [Excalibur](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Excalibur). Today, we reclaim that name from them.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
