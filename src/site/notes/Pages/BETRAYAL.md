The fall of [[Pages/KRAKOA\|KRAKOA]] and destruction of the Martian breeding pits was directly preceded by the betraval of mutants by Mister Sinister. Retrospectively, it is obvious that Mister Sinister was playing a longer game of self-interest that superseded any normal association or allance.

And while the failings of the Generation Four mutants were clearly a design flaw baked into their design, it is now believed that most of the "random" circumstances that led to the creation of Sinister's program were, in fact, orchestrated by him.

***"The nature of that man, Sinister, reaches far beyond any hope of redemption. There can be no salvation for the devil himself."***

Sinister was publicly executed by the Man-Machine Supremacy after defecting.
