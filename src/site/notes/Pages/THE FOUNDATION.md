*(An organizational report prepared in the week following Krakoan Independence)* 

At the formation of the [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]] as the ruling body of Krakoa, the divisions of mutantdom -- of society -- were baked in to permit the naturally occurring fractures of competing ideologies, and the Quiet Council represents the best efforts of mutant elders to produce a government that is wholly representative of the citizens of our nation. 

The Summer, Spring, Winter and Autumn seats represent not only a cross section of personalities and belief systems, but also a psychological spread of predictable mutant responses to internal and external conflicts. It is our hope that through this we can control disharmonious (and unnecessary) aggression that could possibly work against the best interests of Krakoa. 

To that end, only the FORCE protocol of a national surveillance and defense apparatus will be allowed to operate as a fully functioning first-strike mechanism. We will establish a group of [[Pages/KRAKOAN CAPTAINS\|KRAKOAN CAPTAINS]] to act as the military leaders in times of national need, or in response to a time of conflict or war. 

**NOTE: The only exception to this is [Krakoa itself](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Krakoa_(Earth-616)) (and its voice, [Cypher](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cypher)), who stand outside the governance of our mutant nation.**
