**Official Response to Non-Treaty Nations**

All those who have not yet signed the treaty acknowledging mutant sovereignty will be treated publicly as future allies who have not yet realized the benefits of the agreement. 

Firm but friendly diplomatic efforts will continue. This will include weekly phone calls and monthly visits from Krakoan emissaries; educational propaganda blasts via radio, television and internet and invitations of politicians and business leaders to mutant­sposored events in allied territories. 

Punitive measures will be mostly indirect, including increased tariffs from the United States and China. 

All of this assumes a stance of friendly disagreement. But any openly hostile behavior toward mutantkind will be subject to an immediate tactical response (pending discussion and approval from [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]]).

**Unofficial Response to Non-Treaty Nations**

Any attempts by non-treaty nations to secure back-channel conduits for Krakoan medicine will be arranged through the Black King of the [[Pages/HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY\|HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY]]. Failure to work with the Black King will result in intimidation-at his discretion-followed by covert, punitive measures. 

Mutant operative cells will work to undermine the current administration. For now, their primary focus will be the extraction of all mutants currently forbidden from crossing the border and joining their mother nation of Krakoa. In Russia, this effort includes Colossus / Piotr "Peter" Nikolayevich Rasputin.
