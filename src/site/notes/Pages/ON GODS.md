*from the desk of [Doctor Nemesis](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Nemesis?so=search)*:

**Deity:** Fundamentally unscientific piffle. Yet one must painfully acknowledge that, according to some quirk of our reality, narrative abstractions have an annoying tendency to achieve form. Reduced to a processor system, this class of entity might be expressed as follows: 

![Deity.png](/img/user/Assets/Deity.png)

**OBSERVATIONS:**

• Patronage outputs have a constant upper limit, i.e., the personal benefits a user may expect are fixed, irrespective of the number of other users.

• Total system output is a product of total input. This would appear to limit a deity's
capacity for manifestation and agen cy. I speculate:

• **1-100 Worshippers:** The processor cannot manifest far from its cultic input. It is tightly bound to its users.

**• 100-100,000 Worshippers:** The processor achieves a level of independence. It begins to act according to system objectives.

• **100,000+ Worshippers:** the processor is essentially autonomous. Oddly, deities at this level almost never manifest. (Some manner of output->input loop? This would merit further study if literally Everything Else weren't a better use of my time.)

• **Secondary Input:** There seems to be a threshold of mass consciousness beyond which processors cease to require primary input. (I doubt there are any active cults slitting chicken-throats to [Loki](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Loki_Laufeyson_(Ikol)_(Earth-616)), [Hercules](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hercules_Panhellenios_(Earth-616)), etc., yet they refuse to @#& 0/o off.) I speculate they have transitioned from the merely Metaphysical into Enduring Literary Devices -exchanging a high-value/small-dose input for an unexotic but endless supply of human awareness. Which begs the question: If we could delete all memory of, e.g., [Thor](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thor_Odinson_(Earth-616)), from the minds of mankind, would he cease to exist?

*Hm.* Fun idea. We should try.
