CEREBRO 
VERSION 7.0 BUILD 
_

Originally powered by a [Shi'ar](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Shi%27ar) antimatter engine, the current build of Cerebro now runs on a Krakoan [[Pages/SAGE'S LOGBOOK, NO-PLACE\|Pages/SAGE'S LOGBOOK, NO-PLACE]] vent, converted by [Forge](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Forge) to act as an unlimited power source for mutants living on the island. Shi'ar logic diamonds still remain the primary choice for data storage and are also how [Sinister](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Sinister)'s DNA sequencing is cached. 

(NOTE: Forge's increasing mastery of "Krakoan tech" continues unabated. The transition of his prowess with traditional machine building to biological machine building remains impressive. A revolution in Krakoan technology seems imminent.)

**FUNCTIONALITY** 
_

Once a week, [Charles Xavier](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Francis_Xavier) copies the "latest version" of every mutant mind to multiple redundant "cradles" located in several locations across the world. These backups are the essence of each mutant. How they think, how they feel, their memories -- their very being. This partial process takes approximately three hours. 

Once a year, Xavier does a "hard backup" of each mutant on the planet. Unlike the weekly backups, this process is not a partial backup but a "fresh copy" of a whole mind. This process takes three days, during which the process cannot be interrupted and Xavier cannot be disturbed. 

(NOTE: As previously stated, while there has been no experimentation regarding what happens when you combine a mutant MIND with a HUSK that is not their own, it is believed that unless a mutant has some primary or secondary ability to overcome the potential damage such a mismatch would cause, it's likely to be harmful and possibly fatal.)

(NOTE: It is possible for a telepathic operator to replace their own mind with a previous [legacy] version, but doing so is incredibly difficult and would most likely require a skilled and experienced operator.)

(NOTE: Charles Xavier has done this twice.)
