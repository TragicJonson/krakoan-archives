HUMAN > OMEGA SENTINEL PROCESS

1. INFECTION: A human host is injected with Nano-Sentinel technology.
2. NESTING: Self-replicating biological machines propagate in host.
3. REPLICATION: Biological machines replace existing host systems and organs.
4. DORMANCY: During the dormant period, the biological host is partially transformed from organic to machine.
5. ACTIVATION: Post-dormency transformation, a host becomes operative and is capable of activating in proximity to a mutant.
6. UNION: Post-activation, the human host becomes aware of the combined consciousness of it and the Sentinel directives it has been infected with. (this is always a prolonged process that mirrors those recovering from trauma.)
7. ADAPTION: Total integration of host and machine. 
8. OMEGA: Total machine state.
