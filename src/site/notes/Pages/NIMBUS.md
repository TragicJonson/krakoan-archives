Nimbus was once called Nibiru. It began as a frozen gas giant on an elliptical solar orbit that extended beyond the Kuiper belt.

Following the [Badoon](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Badoon?so=search) infestation of the early thirty-first century, the Outreach project was created to convert Nibiru into a super-intellect in the hopes of attracting -- and establishing -- a suitor-alliance with a Type III interstellar civilization.

Mirroring the [Kree](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kree) intelligence model, 100 of the greatest post-human scientists, scholars and artists of their generation submitted to the copying -- and integration -- of their minds into a single thinking machine, called the Nimbus.

Housed in a Nimrod shell, Nimbus' journey from Earth to Nibiru took approximately four years.*

When it crashed into Nibiru, Nimbus tore through the upper atmosphere and mantle of the ice giant and used the force of the impact to inject its self-replicating [[Pages/MACHINES\|MACHINES]] into the core of the planet. 

As Nimbus consumed/converted the iron and nickel into an ever-increasing number of memory farms and logic crystals, its intelligence level grew until the goals of the Outreach project were achieved.

Nimbus achieved Worldmind status ten years after impact. 

*A more linear path would have seen the Intelligence arrive sooner, but it stopped to consume multiple Saturnian and Jovian moons in order to increase its density and intellect (which it calculated would increase the conversion rate of Nibiru).
