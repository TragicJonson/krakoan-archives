REGENT: **FORGEMASTER FEDERAL**

A feudal kingdom of cybiote warriors who defend their land, Infuri is the site of one of the greatest weapons forges in all reality.

In a reality where a sun-dwelling [Celestial](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial) threatened all of existence, it took the discipline and hero-slaying expertise of the Furies to subdue the Celestial when no one else could. Lashing it into the star where it dwelt to trap it in place, the Celestial fused with the energy there and formed the hottest structure in the known universe, the Living Sunstar. Rather than entrust such a volatile thing to that reality's defeated heroes, the Furies slew them all for their failure and took it with them back to the [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]]. There, they took a province by force and founded their home by embedding the Living Sunstar into the ground itself and forming Infuri, the Everforge.

Weapons forged at the heart of the Living Sunstar are unbreakable and some of the finest in all reality. However, the presence of a sun in the center of their nation makes it a hard country indeed, and more and more unbearable as one nears the central forge itself -- but worth it for some of the finest blades in creation, forged by the greatest hero-killers of all time.

Lava, heat and flame are all parts of the land here, but the discipline of the Furies makes it liveable by a highly strict code. Land is passed down through centuries and contracts are sealed in blades and blood. The code of the Furies is a regimen of pain -- both given and received -- and their resistance to discomfort makes them expert smiths indeed.
