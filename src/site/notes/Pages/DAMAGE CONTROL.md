While this corporate entity traditionally serves in a quarantine or repair/rebuild capacity, Damage Control also operates as the archival unit for government-contested metahuman machinery and technology that belongs to missing, incapacitated or deceased individuals where either a clear chain of custody does not exist or the items in question pose an existential threat to the United States. 

Current inventory in the Damage Control Contested Storage facility is made up almost exclusively of advanced schematics and disassembled material created or owned by Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) and Tony Stark (Iron Man).*

LIST OF SECURITY ITEMS (LEVEL 5):
- Sol's Anvil
- Sol's Hammer
- The Bridge
- Iron Man Mark V
- Iron Man Mark VI
- Iron Man Mark VII
- Iron Man Mark VIII
- Rescue Mark I 
- Rescue Mark II
- Antiproton Sling
- Multiversal Beacon

*In the recent past, both Stark and Richards have gone to great lengths to ensure that their technology did not fall into the hands of entities like Damage Control. But their normal avenue of evasion—leaving control of their intellectual property to each other—failed when Richards was missing for a prolonged period of time and Stark was presumed dead.

*Rights to all current material are being contested.
