**CAPTAIN HIERARCHY**
1. [CYCLOPS](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops), CAPTAIN COMMANDER, X-MEN
2. [MAGIK](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Magik), CAPTAIN, SEXTANT
3. [BISHOP](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Bishop), CAPTAIN, [[Pages/HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY\|HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY]]
4. [GORGON](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Tomi_Shishido), CAPTAIN, COUNCIL GUARD

**GORGON** 
While the other three captains have broader, more extensive jurisdictions, Gorgon has a smaller, more specific one.* As one of the most experienced, and most lethal, mutants on Earth, he was chosen by the Captain Commander (after consultation with Wolverine) to act as the personal protector for members of the [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]] (especially when they leave Krakoa). 

*After the events surrounding the assassination of [Charles Xavier](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_X), if an Autumn council member plans to enter a hostile environment, the expectation is that Gorgon will accompany them.
