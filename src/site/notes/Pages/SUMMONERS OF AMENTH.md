Behold the power of the Summoner school of AMENTH. They are nameless adepts and ageless wizards of the black world and can touch that dark place hidden to most practitioners.

Know a Summoner by their mark, which they must wear at all times. See the mark and know them -- not by any other sight, any words or any deeds.

They serve an alien power. A lure deeper than their connection to the waking world. Remember this, and act accordingly.
