Initial establishment of doomsday network based on evolutionary research regarding the extinction level population density of Homo sapiens superior. (See: "The Cro-Magnon problem" by Doctor Alia Gregor.)*

Recruitment of assets In strategic organizations (A.I.M., S.H.I.E.L.D, S.T.R.I.K.E., S.W.O.R.D., ALPHA FLIGHT, H.A.M.M.E.R., A.R.M.O.R., HYDRA) as well as funding from black budgets and other human-centric financial considerations.

Absorption and adaptation of various organizational assets into next-generation infrastructure: BUILD FOR DOOMSDAY.

Operating under the premise that there are three areas of concern (Population, Financial, Territorial), Orchis assets established watchdog programs to observe -- undetected -- mutant influence.

**TWO YEARS AGO: OBSERVATION BEGINS:** 

- ONE YEAR AGO: Population Alert: Instances of X-Gene activation have spiked along with the re-emergence of established mutant alphatypes long observed as active in the mutant cause.
- SIX MONTHS AGO: Financial Alert: Long-observed shell companies wholly owned by the mutant activist, Charles Xavier, quietly purchased the seventh-largest pharmaceutical company in the world and recently announced three new drugs, which are poised to destabilize that industry and spread throughout global financial sectors. 
- TWO MONTHS AGO: Territorial Alert: The mutant nation of [[Pages/KRAKOA\|KRAKOA]] established. 

**OBSERVATION ENDS: ORCHIS PROTOCOLS ENACTED**

*RE: "The Cro-Magnon problem" by Doctor Alia Gregor began as humanitarian research into mutant repopulation following the Genoshan genocide, which resulted in the deaths of over sixteen million mutants.

>[!info] See also:

Doctor Gregor postulated that, despite best efforts, mutantdom would not be able to repopulate to signiticant enough numbers to become the eventual dominant species of Homo sapiens on Earth due to factors including environmental, technological and specific scientific advancements in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. What she found disproved her theory. 

>[!info] See also:
>[[Pages/MACHINES\|MACHINES]]

Not only were mutants repopulating/reappearing at a higher rate than expected, but a regression analysis of previous growth patterns of mutants revealed that, if not for Genosha, mutants would have become the dominant species on Earth within ten years due to cascading biological and cultural mutant-positive variables.

What Genosha bought mankind was time that they didn't know they didn't have. Doctor Gregor's new timeline suggests that humanity has twenty years left.
