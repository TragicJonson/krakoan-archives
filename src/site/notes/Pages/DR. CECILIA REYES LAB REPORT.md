There are 12,000 (and counting) species of ants. There are 1.5 million (and counting) species of fungus. 

There are more viruses than there are stars in the universe -- and in one drop of seawater you can find ten million of them. 

So we should not be surprised by the diversity and evolution of plant intelligence. 

We have Krakoan (with variant strains). 

We have [[Pages/TERRA VERDE\|TERRA VERDE]]AN (with variant strains). 

We have Man-Thing (with variant strains) -- under which we have identified the ManÂ­-Slaughter mutation. 

Each is distinct, but all offer different levels of human-plant symbiosis, telefloronic control, medicinal and technological versatility. 

Of these three, the Man-Thing strain (including the Man-Slaughter sample) seems to concentrate its effect on the autonomic nervous system, resulting in a flood of cortisol and adrenaline, the chemicals of fear. 

The patient reports that the initial symbiosis -- of Man-Slaughter and Jackson Strode -- allowed for a flexible expression of each. But the former has since become dominant and consumptive. He is biologically a plant even if mentally a 
man. 

**Notes: Could Krakoa similarly infect us? By eating its food, breathing its spores, taking its medicines ... are we already in a state of early symbiosis?**
