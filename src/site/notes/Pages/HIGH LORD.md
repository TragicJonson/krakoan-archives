**THE EXTERNALS**

At times believed to be a subspecies or evolved offshoot of mutantdom, it is now believed that the so-called "High Lords" were perhaps an early tendency toward the eventual gifts that mutantkind would come to possess during the pax Krakoa. Much has been supposed of their origin, limitations, and abilities, but it largely remains in the realm of theory. What is not theoretical is their long-term involvement in human politics, finance, and law - they have oft been seen as a sort of "mutant Illuminati." 

In addition to the abilities of very old, powerful mutants, their additional External gifts included: 

1:: RESURRECTION. High Lords of Mutantdom can be killed, but most possess rapid healing traits, and all return (occasionally in a different form) if they meet true death. Mutants suspected to have External traits have indeed been tested with death, returning, at times, several years later. 

2:: COMMUNION. High Lords are always aware of one another, can communicate across great distances, and can come together at will. They are known to possess a shared life force - when one External kills another, their ancient energy is dispersed within the remaining Externals. Additionally, their life force can be contained within a gem, which has been shown to keep it out of the shared energetic loop.
