(NOW THE FIEFDOM OF AMENTH)

REGENT: **FAMINE, PESTILENCE**

The Kingdom of Dryador has fallen to the armies of AMENTH.

[Famine](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Famine) and [Pestilence](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Pestilence) of [[Pages/ARRAKO\|ARRAKO]] now sit upon the throne.

What was once the Kingdom of Seventy Seas now sizzles in the flames of war. The Last Watchtower of Del Di Lorr is conquered. Those who attempted to flee were given plague for their rescuers, a gift to repay their foolishness.

The oceans have been boiled, the tender fish-flesh of their most innocent making a fine feast for the battle-weary conquering army. The towers have been broken open, leaving their scholars and healers to gasp and choke on naught but burning ash, the once-soft sand of the shores turning to black glass in the heat. Dryador has become a hard place to welcome a hard people.

Famine and Pestilence, along with their siblings [War](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/War) and [Death](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Horsemen_of_Death), consider the province an extension of their kingdom-- [[Pages/ARRAKO\|ARRAKO]]. Most have given the recently wartorn region a wide berth, and little is known about life inside the province under its new rulers. However, some unscrupulous entrepreneurs have been in and out of the land already, seeking the finest fresh catch in all [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]].
