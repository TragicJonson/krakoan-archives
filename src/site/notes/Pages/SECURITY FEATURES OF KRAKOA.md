**Plant Control Interface** 
The host (Cassidy) can transmit and translate neural intelligence to plant intelligence and in effect control the external nervous system, activating the island as a responsive environment. 

**Additional Precautions** 
For air and marine vessels, all private, commercial and military channels have been diverted 200 miles by international mandate.
