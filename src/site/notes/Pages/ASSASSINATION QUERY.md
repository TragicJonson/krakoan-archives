**An Account of the Lost**

During the attack on Krakoa, 33 mutant lives were lost, including that of [Charles Xavier](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_X). 

He was almost certainly the primary target, an attempt by the enemy to wipe out the figurehead of mutantkind. 

[[Pages/CEREBRO\|CEREBRO]] was also destroyed by the kill shot. That the enemy understood its psychic storage and [[Pages/RESURRECTION\|RESURRECTION]] capacity is unlikely but not impossible. 

**Technological and Biological Recovery**

A homing device was recovered from the body of Xavier. Its location in the stomach indicates it was ingested within two hours of the attack. The likely source is the champagne or crab cake appetizers from the [Sokovian](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Sokovia?so=search) treaty ceremony. The catering staff has since been discovered bound and gagged in the trailer of one of their delivery trucks. 

The weapons and tactical gear collected from the island are unique in their construction and not the product of a known manufacturer. Though this could be coincidental, they bear some initial resemblance to technology connected to a group {believed to be disbanded) known as "the [Reavers](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Reavers?so=search)." 

**Geographic and Monetary Origins**

The assassins entered the airspace over Krakoa by diverting and parachuting from a transpacific flight bound from Seoul to Honolulu. All on board are believed to be dead, though the entirety of the bodies and wreckage have yet to be recovered. 

The assassins appear to be a blend of passengers and crew, all of whom were registered with falsified documents. It is likely that airport security and/or baggage handlers are also implicated, given the weaponry smuggled on board. 

Initial inquiries indicate the tickets were purchased by credit cards linked to a hedge fund previously domiciled in the Cayman Islands that no longer exists. 

**Preventative Measures**

An emergency proposal to implement a daily EMP blast--to wipe out all traditional electronics on the island--has been approved by the [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]].
