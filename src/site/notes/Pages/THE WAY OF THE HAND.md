THE WAY OF THE HAND IS FOUND IN DEATH. 

It is the cloak. It is the pact. It is freedom. Be determined and advance. When you fear pain, be determined and advance. When you want to live, be determined and advance. We are born to serve, and kill, and die. 

CONSCIENCE IS A PRISON. 

The One seduced by intelligence, The One that must consider the orders of their master, that One walks the path of suffering. Conscience is ego, the exaltation of self-interest above duty, a throne of weakness. Deny conscience. Serve the words of the master. Be as the blade you trust. The blade does not question. The blade is drawn and used and returned. The blade is unburdened by consequence. It is a thing of action, an object of function. The blade holds no guilt. 

THE ONE AT PEACE IS COMPLETELY ONE WITH THEIR MASTERS. 

They serve them as if already dead. The One is free from fear because they have accepted death in the present moment. 

THE ONE WILL RECEIVE A COMMAND TO KILL THAT WHICH SEEMS INNOCENT. 

Doubt will arise within The One. Questioning will still their action. In the moment, The One is betrayed by self, by ego. It is not the task of The One to determine guilt or innocence, for how can they? How can they know the breadth of the whole world, what is precious, and what is not? How can they know which should live and which should die? In truth, they cannot, for The One has been given power and not wisdom. Wisdom belongs to the master. The One cannot trust their feelings. 

TO TAKE UP THE MATTERS OF THE WORLD IS NOT THE TASK OF THE ONE. 

The One, in harmony, understands the world 1s cruel and empty of Justice. To embrace the suffering is a journey of arrogance for there can be nothing done for the world. Even as masters determine what is best, The One cannot allow themselves to be invaded by foolishness 1n the guise of responsibility.
