(EYES ONLY: Fifth Petal Command)

INTERNAL COMMUNIQUÉ FROM THE DESK OF ==REDACTED== 

Results at last: The ==REDACTED== Project has been a struggle from the start, politically speaking. Those crooks at Legacy House didn't realize what they were selling, but Gyrich and his flunkies in Second Petal absolutely did. We've been fending off his grabby hands from the moment we acquired the Asset. If the Central Column hadn't come out so strong in favor of our proposal, the richest research artifact in the mutant world would be liquifying on a shelf—or, more likely, converted into some dreary sidearm. 

Even with ==REDACTED=='s backing, the pressure to demonstrate the value of the modeling facility in the Rub' al-Khali has been intense. I've been quietly informed of at least three attempts to requisition "the bell jar brain," as we've taken to calling it, for projects in more conventional fields. 

But this month's introduction of ==REDACTED== has silenced all detractors. True, autonomous entities that populate the psychic realm within the Asset were already degrading slowly into a state of antisocial stagnation (since we successfully excised the core personality and its capacity to rest). But within hours of the implantation, the decay had accelerated exponentially. A state of self-destructive violence was observed almost immediately and has only deepened since. 

Two fields of immediate action emerge: 

1. On a practical level, we must act swiftly to contain and mitigate the disquiet within the Asset. If we are to continue to benefit from the modeling resource it represents (and safeguard our personnel from potential externalizations), modes of reset are urgently required. 
2. Naturally, the ultimate objective is the application of our results in practical, weaponized for against ==REDACTED==. I'm happy to report that Central Column has taken a direct leadership role in this endeavor, and I'm told a covert intervention analogous to our destablizing impact is already being prepared by Sixth Petal personnel.
