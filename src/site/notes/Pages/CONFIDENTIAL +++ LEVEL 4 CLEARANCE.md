Further to my previous update, my liege -- the other galactic societies have responded with extreme speed…and hunger. Ive taken the liberty of tabulating their responses along with my own thoughts.

****There is a degree of economic necessity for all of us. But these civilizations in particular suffered disproportionately at the hands of the symbiote god [Knull](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Knull_(Earth-616)).

** "The gates of creation are manifold—I vow to open them all." The Utopian Kree oath.

Other interstellar civilizations are responding as they hear the news -- I suspect few will follow Intergalactic Wakanda's example. "The Sol" has already become an informal term for a proposed "new credit."

Earth itself has yet to respond in a unified fashion, but -- begging your highness' pardon--we can hardly expect them to start now.

As for our position: Speaking as your diplomatic envoy to Earth, I would strongly consider accepting [[Pages/KRAKOA\|KRAKOA]]/[[Pages/ARRAKO\|ARRAKO]]'s proposals -- but not too soon. The Alliance remains in a position of considerable strength, and by showing restraint, we can bring some pressure to bear on smaller matters -- such as the Wanda Maximoff situation, which has yet to be resolved, and which many consider an intolerable insult to the dignity of the throne.

*It's not worth going to work over, Paibok -- but you're right. Let's make use their free sample and play it cool until they schedule more time at the table. -- T.*
