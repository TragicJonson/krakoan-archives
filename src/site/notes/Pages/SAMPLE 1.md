Recent experiments involving the dissection* of Morgan Le Fay resulted in the identification of one unidentified malignant component, heretofore referred to as Component Y.** 

UPDATES TO PREVIOUS METHODOLOGY: 

- Include at least one Omega Level Mutate: [Monarch](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Monarch)
- Include mutate assistant of advanced age: [Exodus](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Exodus)
- Include components of [Krakoa](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Krakoa) to protect and sanctify Magica Superior

**RESULTS: *Further notes pending.***

**CONCLUSION:** 

-	The magic of the Superior relies on strength of community, not exercise of power.
-	Three is an insufficient number to form a coven.
-	**Component Y is an active threat to [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]]*** and will require containment both here and at the source.**
