**RE: The resurrection of "dupes"** 

It was our understanding that the purpose of "no copies" was to avoid making duplicates of individuals who are still active. However, we believe that there has been a misunderstanding of what it means to be an individual. 

Genetically derivative or even genetically identical individuals are not necessarily "dupes" (identical twins exist even among humans). Mutants such as [Gabby Kinney](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Honey_Badger), [Madelyne Pryor](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Queen) and [Evan Sabahnur](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Evan_Sabahnur) (and others in situations like theirs) are their own people, regardless of genetics. 

[[Pages/CEREBRO\|CEREBRO]] only recognizes individuals, not "dupes," and all of the above are registered and stored in the system as individuals. 

We formally request that you update the understanding of personhood accordingly as the narrow definition is counter to the point of our work.
