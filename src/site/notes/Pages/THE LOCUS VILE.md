THE SIN-BLOODED SCOURGE OF AMENTH

*"That terrible fate, to be Locus Vile. That privilege of mutilation and scar. That honor of submission and gore."*

**These things are Holy to The Vile:** 
- To abandon yourself, becoming the canvas of Tarn.
- To be teared and hated throughout Amenth, proving the sacrilege ot your being.
- To usher Tarn to new lands, so he may pervert the fauna there.

**KNOW THE GREAT GENOMIC MAGE
TARN THE UNCARING**
The helix bends to Tarn's will. He thinks music and atoms dance. Amenthian mutants gift themselves to Tarn, who sculpts their genes anew. So begins the pilgrimage of pain toward a more profound mutation. Manv perish. Those who live follow him as their god, praying for macromutation.

KNOW THE LOCUS VILE

**MOTHER RAPTURE**
The tamer of the Blade Fish. The mother of the Second Birth, that journey into death.

**HEX BUTCHER**
For his speed, he must eat. For his strength, he must eat. For his joy, he must eat. And so he butchers. And so he eats. And watching, Amino Fetus covets.

**SICK BIRD**
She of brittle bones, maned with tentacles of marrow and nerve. Her spine-spikes bring sepsis and mock coagulation, worming their way to your spine. Invading that sacred cord, she finds communion, knowing the whole of vou.

**MUDGEAR THE RECANTER**
The tumored one, whose gift will bring him death. But first, his enemies. From each orifice of his disfigured arm, a geyser of death. Praise Tarn!

**AMINO FETUS**
The Lumbering Shame, whose touch snuffs the ember of mutation. Know his grasp. know humiliation. But, most vitally, know thIs: Amino Fetus must not eat.
