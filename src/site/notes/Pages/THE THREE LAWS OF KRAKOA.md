(with interpretive annotations for Legionary guidance (K.Wagner_))

**MAKE MORE MUTANTS**

- We cannot and must not enforce a doctrine of compulsory reproduction.
- The FIVE are resurrecting dead mutants on an industrial scale -- righting the genocides of the past. With the benefit of thought and counsel, I believe the most intelligent application of this law is to leave them to it.

**MURDER NO MAN**

- Or woman, or any other. Obviously.
- This law is necessarily reductive to cover a broad base. Politically, it prevents us from provoking non-mutant actors. Morally, it prevents us from sinking to their level.
- I prefer to take a broad ethical interpretation: Kill no one who lacks recourse to [[Pages/RESURRECTION\|RESURRECTION]]. (And even if they do? Try not to. Looking at you, Doctor Nemesis.)
- When a killing is suspected, we must examine intent before we condemn.
- We must see to it that death does not lose meaning, lest life follow suit.

**RESPECT THIS SACRED LAND**

- The Sacred Land is not a place. The Sacred Land is a polity.
- The Sacred Land is mutantkind.
- To diminish or harm any mutant without consent -- in body or mind -- is to disrespect this Sacred Land.
- In all matters -- emotional, physical, sexual and spiritual -- as long as choice and consent are present: Anything goes.

**THE SPARK**

- try
- new
- things
