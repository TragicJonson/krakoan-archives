![Mutant Diplomacy.png](/img/user/Assets/Mutant%20Diplomacy.png)

All current mutant diplomacy -- and the future security and sovereignty of Krakoa -- is dependent on relationships with human nations centering on their need for mutant pharmaceuticals and the Krakoan ability to meet them. 

More than 100 nations have accepted a trade deal with Krakoa. And while negotiations are ongoing with most of the world's remaining nations, some have rejected Krakoan overtures. Nations that have rejected a trade treaty with Krakoa are considered to be naturally adversarial. 

A list of those nations is as follows:
