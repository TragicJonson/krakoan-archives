**MUTANT BREEDING PROGRAM**

When the population level of mutants reached a crisis point and the constant evasion-relocation-controntation cycle made systemic mutant propagation impossible. the remaining mutant leadership* endorsed/approved the creation of the Sinister breeding pits of Mars.

Under the expert hand of chief mutant geneticist Mister Sinister, this strategy mirrored the earth-based Sentinel HOUND program, but instead of focusing on the interbreeding of mutants with powers that lent themselves to detection, pursuit and deception, the Sinister strategy focused on mutants with power sets that had more aggressive, militaristic traits.

These "lost years" of mutant leadership followed the almost universal death or disappearance of senior leaders. and preceding the fall of [[Pages/KRAKOA\|KRAKOA]] and Mars, many beneved rampant rumors that the 'lost years' were not accidental but purposeful. 

**CHIMERA**

The first generation of Sinister mutants were uniformly designed to be divergent copies of a singular DNA source with a pure, uncompromised X-gene. Commonly referred to as "fodder" inside the breeding pits. these mutant soldiers were trained in the Martian underground until they reached the age of 16, at which time they travelled to [[Pages/KRAKOA\|KRAKOA]] to defend the mutant nation-state until it fell 30 years later.

The second and third generations of Sinister mutants were referred to as Chimera class.

The second "Chimera" generation produced mutants that had DNA composed of two separate X-genes, resulting in a mutant with the 'mostly' predictable combined power set or the source mutants.

The third "Chimera" generation produced mutants with an amalgamated DNA featuring up to five X-genes. Outside of predictable failure rate, this third generation of Chimeras was universal successful against the Man-Machine Supremacy, and many believed that this would be the turning point in the war.

However, the fourth generation of Sinister mutants suffered a systemic failure. The entire batch of these [[Pages/OMEGA LEVEL\|OMEGA LEVEL]]-based, Chimera mutants was produced with a corrupted hive mind that was only discovered to be defective after they had destroyed 40 percent of the remaining mutant population and caused the tall of Krakoa itself. They eventually committed mass suicide, collapsing Mars, the Sinister pits and themselves into a self-singularity.
