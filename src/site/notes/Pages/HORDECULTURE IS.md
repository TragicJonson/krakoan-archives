A collaborative group of like-minded agrochemists, biotechnoloÂ­gists and bioengineers who specialize in the genetic manipulation of -- and propagation of -- all things botanical. Their goal is the radical depopulation of humanity and the return of the planet to what they would consider a more pristine state. 

Beyond genetic modifications believed to have been made to themselves (unconfirmed outside of a documented resistance to telepathy), the women of Hordeculture are experts at manipulating the environment to suit their extinction agenda. 

While it is unknown if there are more than four members of Hordeculture, the known existing members are: 

AUGUSTA BROMES 
Agrochemist, 64 years old. 
Best friends with Opal. 

OPAL VETIVER 
Bioengineer, 68 years old. 
Best friends with Augusta. 

LILY LEYMUS 
Geneticist, 71 years old. 
Thinks she's best friends with Opal but isn't. 

EDITH SCUTCH 
Botanical engineer, 81 years old. 
Don't need friends, don't want 'em.
