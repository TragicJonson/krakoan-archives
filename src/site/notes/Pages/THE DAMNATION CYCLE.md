Amino Fetus is a being in the third of four stages making up the Damnation Cycle. With great care this cycle may repeat.

1. ﻿﻿﻿THE ABOMINABLE GERM:

2. ﻿﻿﻿THE ACCURSED EMBRYO:  
    Writhing into the light, the Accursed Embryo seeks out a Master. A great evil from which it is shaped.
3. ﻿﻿﻿THE AMINO FETUS:  
    Eating. Eating. Eating. Swelling into the Lumbering Shame. A Master may know when the Amino Fetus is ripened. A Master may know that the eating must stop
4. ﻿﻿﻿THE ATROCIOUS INFANTS:  
    Having gorged a final time, the infants come. The enders of all. The infants do not feed on life, but the strands of time.
