**THREAT LEVEL: 1
(SCALE: SYSTEM WIDE)**

Despite our best efforts, the influence of [[Pages/ORCHIS PROTOCOL\|ORCHIS PROTOCOL]] continues to grow on Earth. Buttressed by their currently unassailable position encircling the sun, ORCHIS is aggressively recruiting allies among Earth's traditional human power bases and fledgling anti-Krakoan alliances. An additional complication is the proliferation of nonthinking, adaptive sentinel bases (Nodes) in territories belonging to ORCHIS allies. 

While Nodes are easily discovered and quickly destroyed (along with their spy net works, which are traced and sterilized), it's now theorized that these were designed as catalysts for seed events -­created to be narrative evidence of our aggressiveness. And like the burning of fields, our overt action seems to induce new growth -- usually of a stronger strain. 

So unless we can get the root, observation and investigation appears to be our best course of action on Earth. 

But as for the Forge itself -- and Nimrod, who looms within -­destruction remains the highest priority.
