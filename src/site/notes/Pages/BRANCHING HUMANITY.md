**Homo sapiens** 
Humanity will reach a natural evolutionary dead end within two to four generations. 
(Though humans will still outnumber mutants for some time, the asymmetrical strength of the latter will result in a shift in dominance—see: The "100 sheep, 10 wolves" argument.)

**Homo superior** 
Mutantdom is the natural evolutionary successor to humanity. 

**Homo novissima** 
Post-humanity is a manufac­tured branch of humanity not restricted by normal evolu­tionary constraints. 
(The problem with a technolo­gy-based post-evolutionary state is the inevitable—but naturally occuring—paradigm loop between organic and technological constructs. A machine leap makes a post-human leap possible, and a post-human leap makes a machine leap possible—on and on until one of these two eventually reaches an end state.)
