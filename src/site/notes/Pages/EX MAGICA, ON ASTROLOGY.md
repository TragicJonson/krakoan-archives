*Regarding astrology:* It is beyond the knowledge of stars to attempt to divine the actions of others or foreknow future events; the use of cosmic knowledge and placement for such matters of ego are foolish, likened to the lightning itself worrying about the preference of the grain of sand it might strike. It is in this that ego poisons the magic of the individual, the magic of the mortal and the magic of the Sapiens. 

Among mortals, the sentiment of being "under the same sky" persists in the form of modern romantic folly, culturally seeking to comfort a perceived distance by a reminder of shared 
heavenly bodies. However, modern human settlements know very little of community. 

The earliest human communities recalled the ego-destroying power of sky and, prior to the building of settlement walls, had no place upon which to stack a ceiling. But with the walls that divided humankind came the ceilings that blocked them from the sky, the most exact almanac given to creatures of every realm. 

**Theory: X-gene possession inherently seeks quincunx alignment for higher power formation. This is the true purpose of Homo superior. Mutant abilities are purely phenotypical expressions that allow for higher survival capability and an increased ability to exist as a communal organism with shared interest.**
