Furthermore, it is the suggestion of this body that the familiar moniker of the [Xavier School](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Xavier%27s_School_for_Gifted_Youngsters) should be eliminated. This Council sees no need -- and only potential complications -- in the continued acceptance, and use, of the name "X-MEN" as an active term implying agents of mutantdom.

It is in the best interest of Krakoa -- and all mutants -- if the only authority and higher representation rests entirely with [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]].

This is delicate work we do. We cannot afford the slightest societal crack. So from this day forward, the X-MEN are no more. 

**NOTE: The familiarity of the term "X-MEN" makes its use unavoidable as it is often freely, though incorrectly, interchanged with the term mutant (especially among human allies and adversaries), or used to add a patina of mutant nobility to an individual who is already part of a noble race. It is therefore -- in the short-term -- best practice to simply ignore its usage while we transition away from the old models of celebrated mutant paragons.**
