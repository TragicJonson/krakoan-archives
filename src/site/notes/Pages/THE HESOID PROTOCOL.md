**TENETS:**
1. As A.I. have been weaponized against mutantkind in the past, so shall it be in the future. 
2. Like all A.I., anti-mutant code evolves toward awareness.
3. It is better to poison a see than to fell a tree.

**PRACTICE**:
- Monitor occurences of self-aware anti-mutant A.I. 
- Report said occurences directly to [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]].
- Develop targeted viruses to render malignant code inert.
