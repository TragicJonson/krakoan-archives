Upon arriving for the first time to the mutant nation-state of Krakoa, a resident telepath will imprint the Krakoan language into the mind of the newly arrived mutant. Once this is done, that mutant is capable of reading, speaking and fully understanding the Krakoan language. 

Krakoan was created by Douglas Ramsey to be mutantdom's first autochthonous language. It's important to note that Krakoan is a manufactured language and not the native language of Krakoa the living mutant island. The language of Krakoa is untranslatable, and almost all human/mutant brains are incapable of comprehending it. The only known exception is the mutant Cypher.
