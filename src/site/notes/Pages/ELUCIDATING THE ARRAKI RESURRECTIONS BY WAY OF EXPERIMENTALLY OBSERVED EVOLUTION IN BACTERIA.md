To observe evolution in a lab, scientists stymie the growth of E. Coli by introducing it to an antibacterial substrate. After many generations and much death, random mutations give rise to organisms hearty enough to thrive in the hostile environment. At this point, the culture is moved to a stronger antibacterial substrate so further evolution may be observed. The cycle begins again. 

Death. Mutation. Life. 

*Wash, rinse, repeat.* 

I'm sure you see where I'm going with this. I've closely studied the changed genetic profiles of [Nanny](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Nanny), [Orphan-Maker](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Orphan-Maker) and [Wild Child](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Child) after their deaths in AMENTH. I no longer think it adequate to say they came back more. It's hyperbole, true, to say they've undergone a second mutation, but they've changed in unique ways that seem directed. Intentional. It smells of evolution. And why does a mutant evolve? To overcome the trauma of death. 

I'm suggesting something in Nanny and friends' genetic code remembers the "substrate" that ended them in their previous lives. And they have returned better equipped to survive. If they were burned, they will instinctually avoid flame. If they were caught unaware, they will be vigilant. And if they were run down by a lion ... don't be surprised to find their teeth a fair-sight sharper.
