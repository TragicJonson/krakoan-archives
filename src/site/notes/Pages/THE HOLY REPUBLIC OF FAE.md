REGENT: **GREAT HIEROPHANT [MERLIN**](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Merlin)

The kingdom of the wizard Merlin. His desire for law and order has leeched the life from the once-lush and wild land of the fae.

Once, Merlin and his daughter [Roma](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Roma_(Otherworld)) ruled harmoniously over two courts of Fae that were one, like a binary star: he in charge during the year's light or Seelie half, and she ruling over the dark or Unseelie half. The destruction of the [[Pages/CAPTAIN BRITAIN CORPS\|CAPTAIN BRITAIN CORPS]] sent [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]] into chaos, and in the fray the father and daughter turned against one another as each took their court and half of the kingdom for themselves.

Merlin became a strict Hierophant to his Seelie kingdom in an attempt to steer them from hedonism and into magical order. Their faerie nature rebelled, and Merlin fought back against his own people with stricter and more autocratic means, making factory workers from troubadours and soldiers from hunters, channeling massive amounts of fae magic into copper and glass machines. Now the Holy Republic of Fae is a land of cogs and black smoke, iron towers and smog-choked cities.

Without his daughter to temper his ways, Merlin rules the Holy Republic of Fae with a enchanted iron fist. Merlin does not travel without a retinue of fiercely armed and armored elven soldiers who are most loyal to their High Priest.
