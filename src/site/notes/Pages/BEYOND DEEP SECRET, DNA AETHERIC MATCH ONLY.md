Once again, I'm keeping this private record so that -- in case of a sudden resurrection in my near future -- I know exactly what I've done and what I haven't. 

So. What *have* I done? 

I blasted [Henry Gyrich](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Henry_Gyrich_(Earth-616)) out of an air lock, that's what. And frankly, I don't feel a bit bad -- Henry's had something like that coming to him for a very, very long time. Of course, I faked being annoyed about it -- I don't think [Taki ](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Wiz_Kid)would have bought ''genuinely upset.'' 

Obviously, it breaks mutant law-- that charming little fiction Krakoa pretends has weight -- and if anyone found out, it'd make things very awkward. [Hank](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) might let me off, but I can't see anyone else giving me the benefit of the doubt. Even [Erik](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Magneto) --I think, strangely, he'd take it worst of all. He really believes in Krakoa ... Glorp help him. 

Of course, the real danger of Krakoa turning on me before I'm ready would be the chance of bigger dominoes falling. Krakoa is nothing -- useful dupes in the larger scheme -- but if the [Shi'ar](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Shi%27ar) learn that I knew exactly what [[ORBIS STELLARIS\|ORBIS STELLARIS]] was planning? If they understood that [Empress Xandra](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Xandra) dying would be a win condition for us both? Then I'd be in trouble. 

Speaking of win conditions -- the falling [S.W.O.R.D.](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/S.W.O.R.D.) station worked exactly as I hoped. [Cable](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cable)'s techno-organic viral load is just barely under his control now -- perfectly balanced between killing him, which would put things back at square one, and being too weak in his body to make use of. I could have lived with the station crashing into Australia, as well -- it'd accelerate the downfall of Krakoa, but that needs to happen anyway. Still, I'm glad it didn't come to that -- Taki's potentially dangerous, but he's a little too useful right now to go in the hole. 

Who does that leave? [James Hudson](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/James_Hudson_(Earth-616)) is in my pocket. If he ends up as head of [Alpha Flight](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha_Flight_(Earth-616)) -- assuming Alpha Flight survives the interstellar scandal -- all the better. But I've learned not to try to predict such things. I don't think he's a big fan of ORCHIS anymore though. 

Which is ironic ... because ORCHIS are big fans of me. That's what Gyrich got wrong, in the end. Having a mole on the inside? Just a double cross waiting to happen.
