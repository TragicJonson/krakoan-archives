Entry 662041 by [Reed Richards](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Reed_Richards_(Earth-616))

While I can't pinpoint a total, Krakoan gates have emerged in most of the major cities on Earth. They allow instantaneous travel between gates and appear to be extremely resilient. They're remarkable on every level, and I can't help but wonder how these gates could change the world if Krakoa would allow the other 99.9% of the world's population—humans—to use them. The drastic reduction in carbon emissions alone would entirely halt global warming. 

The gates themselves fascinate me. I've documented wormholes that occur naturally, but rarely have I seen ones formed by organic matter with a psychic connection. From studying the gate in Washington Square Park, I can ascertain that it's stable and emits no radiation. So if [Franklin](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Franklin_Richards_(Earth-616)) is to continue with his Krakoan residency, I see no potential for harm. Provided Krakoa, a sentient island, allows it.
