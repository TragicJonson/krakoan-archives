*What is this place?* 

That's the first question. The obvious question. Not to be too flip, but it's the Pit. That's the "what." 

*Where is this place?* 

Now, that's the question that knocks my wig back a little more. Where is this place within Krakoa? I mean, Krakoa is a living being. A mutant, just like the rest of us. So I'm thinking through some possibilities: 

**The Pit is in Krakoa's belly:** It's a living thing, yes, but it doesn't eat. The island siphons energy from every mutant who lives here. So, if it's not actually ingesting anything, then maybe the Pit is the place where its stomach should be? 

**The Pit is in Krakoa's butt:** That's where the waste ends up. And that's how some of the mutants topside would describe me. I mean, I don't think it's right, but you have to at least consider it. 

**The Pit is in Krakoa's heart:** No. That sounds dumb as hell. 

**The Pit is in Krakoa's brain:** This one is interesting to consider. Like, which part of the brain? But then I have to wonder if Krakoa even has a brain. I mean, why am I assuming Krakoa conforms in any way to human physiology? 

Maybe it's more like a leech, which has 32 brains. Or the hagfish, which has four hearts.  

*How will I escape this place?* 

Turns out that's the easy part.
