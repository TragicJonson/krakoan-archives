NON-EUCLIDEAN PSYCHIC HABITAT

[David Haller](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Legion)'s mind has organized itself on more than one occasion into a functioning pocket universe, often absorbing elements (and individuals) from baseliine reality. This would appear to be the first time he has done so by design. 

While Haller has sequestered his physical self on the sum1miit of Olympus Mons, the abstract and functionalily limitless space he has composed is acceÂ·ssible to all mutants via the Temple Gate on [[Pages/ARRAKO\|ARRAKO]], thanks to the Krakoan portal seed he planted within his own psyche.

What he intends to do with this remarkable realm, floating like a conceptual is and within the infinite astral plane, remains to be seen.
