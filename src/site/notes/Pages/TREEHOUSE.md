How the Treehouse came to be is an interesting story. The [White Queen](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Emma_Frost) rocked the New York real estate world by wielding her super power: her checking account. The terms of the billion-dollar deal were not disclosed; however, Emma Frost has said, "As a former member of the X-Men, I am proud to be able to make sure that our homeworld has a team dedicated to its preservation in one of my favorite cities. It's a reinvestment of much of the money from the sale of Krakoan medicines."

The existing structure was taken down overnight in total silence, and the mutants began working the land in preparation for the arrival of the Treehouse from Krakoa. 

[Cyclops](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops) and [Jean](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Jean_Grey) met with [Forge](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Forge), [Cypher](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cypher) and Krakoa to review what would be needed for a permanent home for the X-Men in Manhattan. Rather than waste months on design, Krakoa grew a special small tree that would become the landmark at the southwest corner of the Central Park 86th Street Transverse. As the ideas began to take shape, Forge began binding the young seedling into a bonsai tree, not with copper but with bespoke cables packed with technology, which would grow in parallel with the tree. 

[Tempo](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Tempo)'s gift was key in aging the small bonsai tree. It should be noted that both Tempo and Forge were almost named to the inaugural Krakoan X-Men team. They were both happy to serve on the creation of this new living headquarters. Once everyone was happy with how the tree looked, it was transported with care to Manhattan, where Tempo turned the eighteen-inch tree into one that was over eighteen stories. It is believed to be the greenest structure in the world and a boon for local wildlife. The Audubon Society is reeling from the sight of a snow owl that appears to have moved into the canopy. 

Seneca Gardens is a free, open park space for the people of New York City, with Krakoan [[Technology\|Technology]] highlighting mutant achievements and a memorial to great mutants who are no longer with us. The X-Men hope you'll visit when you're in Manhattan.
