This has become a working umbrella term for the gathering of mutants into specific groups, or circuits, in which their complementary powers are synchronized with one another to achieve a specific goal. The earliest named example of this is probably the **FASTBALL SPECIAL** -- a combat tactic in which two mutants (crossref :: wolv/002/02 :: clss/002/06) coordinate their abilities to create a simple long-range attack of a type neither could have achieved on their own. 

However, the best example of mutant technology as it is now understood remains **THE FIVE** -- a circuit of five mutants (crossref :: resr/001/01) formed specifically for the bodily [[Pages/RESURRECTION\|RESURRECTION]] of other mutants. (Though full resurrection requires a "second stage" of telepathic surgery, this can be performed by any single standard telepathic talent with access to Cerebra resources.) 

In this light -- considering the Five as a natural evolution of the Fastball Special -- the question must be asked: given that the Five allows mutantkind an infinite timeline in which to experiment with mutant technology, what might they in turn evolve toward? 

**THE SIX** is the first step toward answering that question.

**SECOND STAGE CIRCUIT (THE SIX)**

Designated backups listed for situations such as injury or potential retrieval of ==REDACTED== in bulk.

THE CONTROL . .. Takeshi Matsuya aka [Wiz-Kid]: :
High-level technopath with the adaptability necessary to align and adjust mutant circuits in operation.:: 
	Backup: No Name Given [Forge](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Forge?so=search) 

![P.png](/img/user/Assets/P.png)
THE POWER .... [Fabian Cortez](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Fabian_Cortez?so=search) [ No Name Given] : :
Energy augmenter. Provides the boost required for circuit operation inside the ==REDACTED==.:: 
Backup:==REDACTED== [No Name Given] 

![S.png](/img/user/Assets/S.png)
THE SHIELD ... Hisako Ichiki aka [Armor] : :
Generates a protective exoskeleton that, once aligned with the Power and the Control, extends to the entire circuit.:: Backup: Sally Blevins [Skids]

![G.png](/img/user/Assets/G.png)
THE GUIDE .... Eden Fesi [Manifold] : :
A space-folder or "quintician," uniqely able to both navigate the ==REDACTED== and assist in forming the ==REDACTED== once there. : : 
Backup: None as yet.

![E.png](/img/user/Assets/E.png)
THE EYE ... Peter Quinn [Peeper ] : :
Broad-spectrum telescopic/microscopic/spectroscopic vision. Able to discern the kirbon particles that form ==REDACTED==. : : 
Backup: No Name Given [Doc] 

![F.png](/img/user/Assets/F.png)
THE FOUNDRY ... Gloria Munoz [Risque J] : :
Implosive field generator. Condenses ==REDACTED== from the high-density kirbon fields found inside the ==REDACTED==. : : 
Backup: Shen Xorn [Zorn]

**OPERATION OF BOTH CIRCUITS** 
Unified by the **Control**, the **First Stage Circuit** acts as a resource/anchor for the Guide, allowing him to translocate the entirety of the, **Second Stage Circuit** while saving his energies for the retrieval work. 

The **Second Stage Circuit** arrives at the staging platform constructed by previous Second-Stage Operations at the ==REDACTED== (cross ref:: fshr:000:00), and then
