**ABIGAIL BRAND :: PERSO1NAL LOG Z-1-12 21/ 1**

*''Eyes only.''* Never more than now .. l'm only keeping this record in the event of post-resurrection memory loss -- it's. important I know what l've done. And who I've done it to...

So, for the record when Emperor Hulkling sent that distress signal to 
Alpha Flight, there was every chance Gyrich would have passed it along to the Avengers. Hulkling's one of their own -- their problem, by his thinking. And, of course, they'd have all gone running to help. 

I just couldn't have that.

It's not enough to have the Shi'ar and the Zn'rx in our corner. I need the Kree/Skrull Alliance as well if I want really pull with the Galactic Council. That means getting on the royal family's good side, which was already going to be difficult -- with the emperor's dead mother-in-law stinking up the afterÂ­ party, it'II take a miracle. 

So I intercepted the distress signal -- the way I can intercept all signals sent to the Alpha Flight Space Station. 

And of course, I blocked it. 

Gyrich never even knew it existed -- neither will the Avengers. And S.W.O.R.D. gets to ride to the rescue. I've, had nano-cameras on Throneworld since construction started, so I can pick the perfect moment to save the emperor's life. That way, even when he finds out about Maximoff and the crap really hits the fan -- *he'll owe me*. It's not perfect, but it'll let me start making the real moves.

Eventually, the goal is ==REDACTED== Storm ==REDACTED==.

Needless to say, if [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]] found out about that... Well.

That's why it's *''eyes only.''*
