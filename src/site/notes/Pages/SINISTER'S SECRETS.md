**Known to the [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]]:**
- [Magneto](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Magneto) and [Charles Xavier](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_X) were in secret partnership with [Moira MacTaggert](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Moira_MacTaggert) as architects to Krakoa. Their plans have been charted by Moira's mutant gift -- she has lived multiple lives, her death annihilating a timeline and carrying her knowledge into her next life.
- Moira's secret she didn't want anyone to know? "We always lose.''

**Known only to the mutants involved.**
- When it was clear Xavier and Magneto wouldn't bring back [Destiny](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny) (on Moira's orders), Mystique brought her back herself. This included impersonating Xavier and giving a Cerebra helmet to [Hope Summers](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Hope_Summers), who resurrected Destiny with the Five. 
- Omni-linguist mutant [Doug Ramsey](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cypher) and [Warlock](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock) have integrated with the living island Krakoa, and were always aware of Moira... and prevented Destiny and Mystique's attempt to kill her. Instead, Moira went on the run, depowered. 
- The X-Men have wiped the brains of a human reporter to prevent the secret of mutant [[Pages/RESURRECTION\|RESURRECTION]] coming out.
