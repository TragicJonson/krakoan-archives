*From Sage's Logbook*

**1. The Shi'ar Question:** 

//Further investigation has revealed the [Shi'ar](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Shi%27ar) invitation to the Hellfire Gala was accompanied by a request for logic diamonds. What was initially believed to be a gift to the mutants was in fact a requested donation.

//[Emma Frost](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Emma_Frost) denies any knowledge of this. 

//The message's origin has so far proved untraceable. 

**2. The [[Pages/TERRA VERDE\|TERRA VERDE]]AN Question:**  

//Whoever cut off the telefloronic feed -- making the [[Pages/TERRA VERDE\|TERRA VERDE]]ANS go rogue during the gala -- could have been acting out of benevolence (encouraging the nation's freedom) and/or hostility (hoping to undercut any Krakoan diplomatic efforts).

//Or it might have been a distraction, so that the trouble in Madripoor could play out before X-Force became aware of what was going on. 

**3. The [Madripoor](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Madripoor) Question:** 

//Does the same logic then extend to the burned Marauder, the dead Russians, and the Arakkii pirate? Is there another sort of distraction at play? A misdirection? Like a shell game? 

//Upon relaying these questions to Wolverine by comm, I received the following response: 

"There's only one way to be sure, and that's to hunt this Arakkii #%$@ down."
