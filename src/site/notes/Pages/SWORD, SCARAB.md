The Forging: Crafted in four parts to celebrate the birth of their four children, the Scarab blade was forged by Isca the Unbeaten as a gift for her brother by marriage, [Apocalypse](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Apocalypse).

Made from the melted and recast blades of the vanquished Uhari royal vanguard, the Scarab blade is a sovereign weapon of a broken kingdom, fitting for the Genesis line of Okkara.
