| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS017-001::FIRST VARIETY::"HALF-BOT"          | All the functionality of the OS016 Tactical Combat Droid you know and love, more efficient than ever -- and now with an additional organic component to induce psychological horror in any foe. Please specify planetary origin of corpse when ordering.                                |
| OS017-002::SECOND VARIETY::"MR. ELOQUENT"     | Augmented for melee combat -- with the return of OS015's award-winning "atomic chain saw" -- 017-002 comes media ready with one of five winning personality types, each with a believable preprogrammed backstory for those vital to-camera monologues.                                 |
| OS017-003::THIRD VARIETY::"THE ELECTRIC HEAD" | For years, we were told that the problem with vat-grown telepathic super-brains was getting them out of the vat. So we brought the vat to us, built into a fully functional OS016 Bipedal Tank Unit. Just the thing to crush your enemies... physically and emotionally.                |
| OS017-004::FOURTH VARIETY::"ORBIS EXTREMIS"   | Sometimes evolution needs a little help -- like the raw power of an "Orbis Stellaris" brand organo-mechanical fusion shell, routed through the brain of an Alpha-class psychic sensitive. That means laser-focused control of any element on the battlefield... or it in the boardroom. |
| OS017-005::FIFTH VARIETY::"DEATH GRIP"        | OS017's emphasis on psychic combat doesn't mean we've forgotten the traditional pleasures of biological warfare. 017-005 combines the next-gen necrotic bacteria with uploads of [Kree](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kree), [Xandarian](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Xandar) and [Centaurian](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Centauri?so=search) unarmed combat styles for the perfect "one-touch" kill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
