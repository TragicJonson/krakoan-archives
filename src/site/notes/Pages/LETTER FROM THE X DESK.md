Since [S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/SHIELD?so=search) @#%$ the bed, we've tracked much of the mothballed ordnance using [Fury](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Fury)'s own hidden and private transponders. 

It's given us a more complete picture of the major players in the global arms race. What was interesting is that some of our stolen Helicarriers were taken from some thieves in Australia earlier this week and sold to the [[Pages/HOMINES VERENDI\|HOMINES VERENDI]] government. Madripoor is both a fabulously wealthy and terribly poor country. It's got a kleptocratic government, and it's been swindled out of billions in crypto. There is some evidence that their U.N. representative [Donald Pierce](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Pierce)'s bills are going unpaid in NYC -- [[Pages/HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY\|HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY]] seems to be flexing one of their most effective weapons: financial warfare. 

I know some of you have been invited to visit [Feilong](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kelvin_Heng_(Earth-616))'s Martian outpost, and I would appreciate it if you would share any reports with this desk. An island of mutants was dangerous enough--now there is a planet of them. The panic in the air is palpable in some circles, and I need to stress that a first strike of any meaningful kind is not in the offing from Krakoa. There are very powerful people on this planet acting like the taking of Marswas a provocation and not a de-escalation. We have no official desk tracking the threat that human supremacists may present, so for the time being, I'd like to put my tired eyes on anything of interest in that department.
