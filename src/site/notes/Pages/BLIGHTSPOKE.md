REGENT: **UNKNOWN**

This place is poison. The land itself leeches life, brings death. Turn away and know that nothing here is worth the sacrifice of life. While it is true that many things of value lie within, most would not survive the danger long enough to spend their riches.

A celestial graveyard of failed realities, Blightspoke serves a necessary function -- a home for things that are a threat to anywhere else. From half-baked singularities to the shattered bones of gods, Blightspoke teems with the dangerous trash of every reality: irradiated land, castles burned by dragonfire, things with deadly, contagious, infectious half-lives.

Blightspoke is an impenetrable death trap due to the many dangers contained in the collapsed realities. If the dangers of Blightspoke could be mitigated, [[Pages/THE CROOKED MARKET\|THE CROOKED MARKET]] would be the immediate beneficiary.

There's only one real face with a name in all of the Blightspoke, and it's not a friendly face. It's said if you see footorints in the dark sand blistering your feet, they belong to sheriff Gia Whitechapel and her posse. If the enormous mining machines that rip the guts of Blightspoke apart cannot fetch your desire, the Sheriff and her posse can lead you there -- or die trying. Don't try to raise your head across the desert without her -- her long rifle sight can see anything, anywhere in the Blightspoke, and it's likely she can hit it, too.

Despite the threats and legends, Sheriff Gia and her posse are not well known. To most, the Blightspoke is a whirling crater, a burning slice of [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]] for things so dangerous, they require removal from normal reality.

And no one goes there.
