Formerly the Agents of S.T.R.I.K.E., these psychically gifted individuals served their country as the PSI Division of one of Britain's top intelligence offices.

While [S.T.R.I.K.E.](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Tactical_Reserve_for_International_Key_Emergencies_(Earth-616)) disbanded prior to working with [Pete Wisdom](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Peter_Wisdom_(Earth-616)?so=search), [Betsy Braddock](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Psylocke) herself was once among the PSI division, developing close relationships with [Tom Lennox](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Lennox_(Earth-616)?so=search) and [Alison Double](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Alison_Double_(Earth-616)?so=search). The work done by S.T.R.I.K.E. was eventually subsumed into the R.C.X., which then became Wisdom's own agency, Black Air.
