"People always talk about the future as if it's bright, promising, limitless. Because people - - whether human or mutant - - are in denial of their mortal coil. The only thing you can count on is the last gulp of air you took into your lungs and whatever you're holding in your hand. If there's one certainty to the arc of the universe, it's this: The future is death. The second law of thermodynamics teaches us this. [[Pages/THE MANY LIVES OF MOIRA X\|THE MANY LIVES OF MOIRA X]] have shown me this. Unless we escape physics. Unless we escape biology. Unless consciousness is not yoked to the physical world that will fall to ruin. I'm talking about a digital cerebrum. The brain-net. The potentiality of the Phalanx. Therein lies the ultimate power of immortality."
