**PRISONERS IN THEIR OWN LAND**

When [[Pages/ARRAKO\|ARRAKO]] fell to the Horde of Annihilation, the millions of mutants inside its walls found themselves trapped in the vassal mutant state with no chance of escape, resistance or insurrection.

Vile school omnipaths were used to uncover militant thought, and Vile stealth suppressors were imbedded within Arakko to depower and defuse any mutant uprisings.

Abyssal prisons were constructed and manned by the [[Pages/SUMMONERS OF AMENTH\|SUMMONERS OF AMENTH]] and Arakko, the latter revealing the corruptive nature of that station and their undying allegiance not to the Golden Helm or the mutant state, but to the expansion of their own power and twisted religion.

**WHAT IS TO COME**

Idyll, daughter of Idyll, son of Idyll, seer of this generation, gave one last prophecy before she was silenced by a Vile engineer. The words were as follows:

"Only under the black moon will the two become one. A white light will judge them, and a red land will see them split forever."

Make of that what you will.
