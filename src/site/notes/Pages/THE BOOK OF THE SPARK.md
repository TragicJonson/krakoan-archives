FIRST FLORILEGIUM 
*DEFINITIONS AND ABSTRACTIONS*, 1:1-7

This is not a mutant religion. 
This is a way of living. Of loving and expressing and fighting and being. It moves us to adapt without restraint. It does not require prayer nor veneration. It does not demand that you put away your old gods. The spark is not jealous. 
The spark is innovation and risk and mischief and courage. 
If we allow it to guide us -- if we invite it to inspire our thoughts and actions -- I truly believe it will save us. The spark is anathema to meaninglessness. 
The spark is creative. The spark is patient. The spark is bright and beautiful, despite having no form or mind. In truth, the spark is barely real at all. The spark is just an idea. 
And yet? 
The spark will burn to ash anyone who ==REDACTED== with the right of mutants to pursue happiness.
