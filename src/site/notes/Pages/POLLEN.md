Pollen has become an epidemic-level street drug in a short space of time. There are many versions available worldwide, but the only consistent source and product comes from the so-called Flower Cartel, which is believed to be involved in a violent campaign to wipe out any competition and interference. 

Jeff Bannister is a senior narcotics agent notable for his decorated history in the Sinaloa and Chihuahua states of Mexico as well as his undercover work in Colombia and Venezuela. He is divorced, but after his daughter was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago, he requested and was granted a stateside transfer. 

Ever since he began investigating pollen, he has been reporting to multiple superiors, one of whom he suspects heads a shadow group 
within the agency devoted to mutant surveillance.

When he proposed to arrange a covert operation-with a team posing as members of the narcotics trade eager to do business with the Flower Cartel-he did not run into the usual tangle of red tape and debriefings but instead received an immediate green light and seemingly unlimited resources. 

Bannister's orders are unclear. On the one hand, his superiors seem to wholeheartedly endorse his proposal to crack down on the Flower Cartel. 

On the other hand, he has taken several calls from the FBI, FBN, DEA, FDA and even the State Department. They all cite dissatisfaction with the manufacture, regulation and distribution of Krakoan pharmaceuticals. They have (so far unproven) suspicions that a mounting black market may tie back to the [[Pages/HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY\|HELLFIRE TRADING COMPANY]].

They have asked him to consider -- if the situation permits, of course -Â­keeping channels open. 

Because collaborating with the drug traffickers will allow for a campaign of espionage, subversion, sabotage and -- possibly -- profit. 

The Flower Cartel has since proposed a meeting. 

The location: deep country Alaska.
