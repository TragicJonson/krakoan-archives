**SENTINEL TO NIMROD PROGRESSION**

**SENTINEL (ALPHA)**
Non-sentient, mutant-hunting robots based on non-replicating, adaptive technology. (Mark I-Mark VIII)

**MASTER MOLD**
A replicating, adaptive (fixed or mobile) Sentinel factory that is self-aware and capable of creating Sentinel drones. 

**MOTHER MOLD** 
A replicating, adaptive Sentinel factory that is self-aware and capable of creating Master Molds. While a Master Mold is incapable of improving beyond its ultimate Sentinel state, it's theorized that, given enough time, a Mother Mold is capable of producing purely adaptable machines based on Nano-Sentinel technology. 

**OMEGA SENTINEL** 
A human infected with Nano-Sentinel technology and progressively transformed from human to machine. 

**NIMROD** 
A pure Nano-Sentinel construct. Anti-mutant. Adaptive. Self-aware. Self-replicating. Virtually indestructible.
