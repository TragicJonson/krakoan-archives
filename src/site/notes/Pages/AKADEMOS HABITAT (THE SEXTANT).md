The Akademos Habitat, also referred to as the Sextant, is a collection of biomes that serves as the home to younger generations of mutants. The Akademos also serves as an education center and training facility, where the young mutants exchange ideas and learn from one another, forgoing formal classroom studies and student/teacher relationships. All are students. All are teachers.
