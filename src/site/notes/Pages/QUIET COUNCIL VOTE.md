Captain Commander Bishop had been lobbying behind the scenes for [[Pages/THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA\|THE QUIET COUNCIL OF KRAKOA]] to provide a directive for mutantdom to confront the [[Pages/THREAT ANALYSIS, ORCHIS\|THREAT ANALYSIS, ORCHIS]] with extreme prejudice. 

The hawks on the council presented the matter as an existential threat to mutantdom's existence, but the doves won the day, instead hoping to "kill 'em with kindness,'' as the Queens implored. 

Destiny was all for destroying them, but made it clear that Quiet Council hands in the air would not provide a path forward. Sinister laughed, and when it was clear that the matter would not pass, Xavier also abstained. 

YES:
- Shaw
- Exodus
- Magneto

NO:
- Red Queen
- White Queen
- Nightcrawler
- Colossus
- Storm

ABSTENTIONS
- Sinister
- Mystique
- Destiny
- Xavier

When telepathically told of the outcome, Captain Commander Bishop simply said, "It will be interesting to see what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back ... and now I know who I need to work on.''
