The Boneyard has a "pod" structure. Each level forms a ring out from the center, and these rings form a light well down to the leisure area and Hanging Gardens. Flyers can use this open space to fly up and down to the various floors. For non-flyers, the staircase is a continuous spiral flowing around the outside of the light well. 

The Boneyard is living, sentient and can grow as needed. It can become taller or wider. Its roots can dig deeper into the ground, opening new caves. Its exterior can become spiked and angular, should outside defense become necessary.
