The declaration of mutant sovereignty -- and subsequent treaty ratification -- has led to what [Xavier](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_X) refers to -- hopefully -- as a leap toward globalization. The political, economic and even cultural implications of this moment are too recent and numerous to fully comprehend, but one definitive result has been the widespread demilitarization and de-escalation of violence in conflict zones. 

Is this because the world feels a sudden, if not momentary, sense of unity and safety and peace? Or is it because military resources are being conserved and readjusted in anxious preparation for what might come next? 

Whatever the reason, thousands of members of military divisions have found themselves pulled from the field and bored by garrison life. The high stakes and spiked adrenaline of the combat zone -- dodging bullets and hunting down enemy forces and fighting for one's country -- have been replaced by passing barracks and uniform inspections. 

MERC grew out of this reduction and sequestration. The top-secret paramilitary unit is driven by two things: the want for heavy combat tempo and high-dollar payment. They have declared themselves loyal to no nation and no cause except themselves. 

There will one day be a large-scale war, but until then, the MERCs are content to fight the million little wars that still take place in the shadows. 

[Beast](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) may or may not have reached out -- without consulting the rest of his team, via a shadow account -- to inquire about their services.
