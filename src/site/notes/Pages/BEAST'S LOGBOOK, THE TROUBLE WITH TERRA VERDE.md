**THEN:** 
The South American country initially held off on signing the treaty because of the time and finances so far invested in telefloronics, a neuro-responsive green tech they hoped would boom their impoverished economy and make them into a global player. The president more than once cited the nation of Wakanda as an aspirational model. 

The declaration of mutant sovereignty -- and the introduction of Krakoan technology to the marketplace -- nullified all their efforts and investments. 

With his country in crippling debt, the president had no choice but to sign with the mutants. But an insurgency rose up against him. The group of militants -- consisting of the scientists who had given their lives to the study and development of telefloronics -- call themÂ­selves MUERTE VERDE, the Green Death. They activated their telefloronic prototypes and made themselves into symbiotes -- both flesh and botanical -- living weapons. 

The president's son was among them. 

**NOW:** 
Several months ago, X-Force staged a stealth assault on Terra Verde. The telefloronic threat was believed to be overcome. 

But now the country has gone dark. All communication with the government and military has abruptly cut off.
