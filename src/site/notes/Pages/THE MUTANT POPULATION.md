Entry 661026 by [Reed Richards](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Reed_Richards_(Earth-616))

Exponential growth and horrific decimation has marked the mutant population in the last decade. Is it any wonder they wish to band together, away from the humans who would harm them?

At this point, the island of Krakoa houses almost every mutant, which makes it the most powerful stronghold on the planet. And also the biggest target. Having our son move there feels wildly irresponsible, especially considering he's an "[[Pages/OMEGA LEVEL\|OMEGA LEVEL]] mutant." While I don't know the specifics of the designation, I understand it puts him in rarified air within the mutant community as one of their most popular members. I have no doubt the X-Men will come for my son, regardless of our wishes.
