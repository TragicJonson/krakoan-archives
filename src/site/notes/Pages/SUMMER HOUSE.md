The Summer House is a Krakoan biome located adjacent to the [Blue Area of the Moon](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Area_of_the_Moon). Occupied by the Summers clan and other mutant allies, the base also serves as a departure point for first response/ first strike capabilities. 

**NOTE: While all mutants are technically welcome, [Vulcan](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Vulcan) has been bringing home quite a few acquaintances from the Krakoan mainland who have stretched the acceptable bounds of decorum.**
