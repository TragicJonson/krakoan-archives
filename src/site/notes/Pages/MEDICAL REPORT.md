**PATIENT FILE: #14** 
RE: [Synch](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Synch)'s mutant gift 
-
Earlier today, the X-Men faced a hoard of monsters and came away victorious at a heavy price. [Cyclops](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops) was murdered by some monsters in battle, but that is not the issue that has me working late tonight. 

I traveled to the [[Pages/TREEHOUSE\|TREEHOUSE]] in New York and examined Synch (Everett Thomas), to whom something remarkable had occurred. Synch's mutant gift allows him to borrow with a high degree of efficiency the mutant gifts of others. To my knowledge, he has not found a mutant gift that he cannot replicate. However, his syncing ability has always required "near field'' communication with the mutant he is attempting to copy. 

Today's event triggered a remarkable response in which Thomas deployed the powers of Patient File #2 Marvel Girl ([Jean Grey](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Jean_Grey)). Grey was off-world at the time of the event in question -- making it highly unlikely that Synch reached out across the millions of miles across the vacuum of space to join with Jean's gift. 

The only plausible explanation returns to the previous entry for this patient. The resurrection protocols are increasing the previous baseline powers, and Synch's power set may now include the ability to retain a limited "muscle memory." His close proximity to Jean since moving to New York may also have helped him pull off this feat. 

It should also be noted that Synch is one of my oldest patients after his time in the Vault. His mind is over five centuries old, and it's possible that old dogs can, indeed, learn new tricks. So, whether it's mental, physical or a combination of both, we have a lot more studying to do. Unfortunately, my pleading with him to return to Krakoa for more examinations was rebuffed, and I didn't push too hard. Cyclops' death, while a temporary setback, has deeply upset everyone and given our heroes a public relations hand grenade. Synch promised to get home when he can, and for now, that will have to be good enough. 

We define an "[[Pages/OMEGA LEVEL\|OMEGA LEVEL]] mutant" as having no upper limits to their powers, and it may be that we are witnessing the emergence of a new Omega in Synch. It's unclear what, if any, role [[Pages/RESURRECTION\|RESURRECTION]] has played in the ability to "recall" Jean's powers, more data is needed.
