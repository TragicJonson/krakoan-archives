![Contested Avalon.png](/img/user/Assets/Contested%20Avalon.png)

- ﻿﻿'Conquered [[Pages/AVALON\|AVALON]]' represents areas formerly under the rule of [Morgan Le Fay](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan_Le_Fay?so=search), now held by [King Jamie](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Monarch?so=search) ("the Mad"). Some areas formerly under the rule of Queen Regent Le Fay are not currently under witchbreed control.
- ﻿﻿While Kobold Battalion made it far enough forward to strike at Castle Camelot, the forces as a whole have not made it beyond the indicated line. For more on the geographical choke point marking the end of the [White Witch](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Opal_Luna_Saturnyne_(Earth-9)?so=search)'s push forward and the official and brutal losses suffered there, see "The Battle of Imbolc Eve."
- ﻿﻿While this map shows movement and placement of forces, [[Pages/OTHERWORLD\|OTHERWORLD]] is a place of constant flux due to the thoughts and ideas that form it. Consider, then, the strength of a reality-warping [[Pages/OMEGA LEVEL\|OMEGA LEVEL]] mutant such as our Monarch.
