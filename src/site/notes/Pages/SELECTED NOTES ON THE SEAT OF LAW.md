**ORA SERRATA SITS IN THE SEAT OF LAW.

**FOURTH LIGHT OF [[Pages/THE GREAT RING OF ARRAKO\|THE GREAT RING OF ARRAKO]].**

**FIRST OF THE TWILIGHT SEAT.**

**ARBITRIX OF THE INWARD WATCH.

The Seat of Law preserves and sanctities the primacy of the Rite of Challenge.

The Inward Watch are enforcers of Arakki law. In practice, their duties are twofold:

1. To witness, regulate and record all Challenges.
2. To retrieve -- and, if necessary, destroy those those who flee a Challenge.
