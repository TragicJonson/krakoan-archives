Contained in this network of files are data from the Krakoan era of Mutantdom (through the events of 'Judgement Day') that capture essential information about the nature of the sovereign mutant nation, along with its citizens, industries, enemies, allies, and more. 

*(NOTE: Many data files deemed "inessential" to the broader knowledge base of the mutant species (e.g. first-hand accounts of negligible events) or having little interconnection with other data points (e.g. biographies of the "Children of the Atom" team) have been intentionally omitted from this record, so as to preserve the utility and broader scope of the network.)*
